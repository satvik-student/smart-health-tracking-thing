# 🔔 Push Notifications Status

## ⚠️ Current Limitation: Expo Go

**Push notifications don't work in Expo Go (SDK 53+)**

### What Works Now ✅
- ✅ **In-app notification list** - View all notifications
- ✅ **Pull to refresh** - Get latest notifications
- ✅ **Mark as read** - Track read status
- ✅ **Badge count** - Shows unread count
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - When app is open

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- ❌ **Remote push** - Can't receive notifications when app closed
- ❌ **Background delivery** - No notifications in notification tray

---

## 🚀 Solution: Create Development Build

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Testing with Expo Go)
**Current Setup:** Everything works except remote push
- Notifications appear when app is open ✅
- Must manually refresh to see new notifications
- Perfect for development/testing

### Option 2: Full Feature (Production Ready)
**Create Development Build:**

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure project
eas build:configure

# Build for Android
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Build for iOS
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

After installing the development build on your device:
- ✅ **True push notifications** - Works when app closed
- ✅ **Background delivery** - Appears in notification tray
- ✅ **All features enabled** - Full functionality

## 📱 How It Works Now (Expo Go)

### For Patients:
1. Open app → See notifications list
2. Pull down to refresh → Get latest
3. Tap notification → Mark as read
4. Badge shows unread count

### For Doctors:
1. Create notification on web dashboard
2. **Notification saved to database** ✅
3. Patient must open app to see it
4. (With dev build: Patient gets push immediately)

## 🎯 Recommendation

**For Development/Testing:**
- Current setup is fine ✅
- Test all notification features except push
- Focus on UI/UX and functionality

**For Production:**
- **Must create development build** 🚀
- Required for real push notifications
- Takes 10-15 minutes to set up
- Free with Expo account
